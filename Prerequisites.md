<h1>Variables, Methods, and Control Structures in Java</h1>
<h2>Prework</h2>
<b>**Only if you are Able**</b> 
<br><br>
Please watch the video below to familiarize yourself with the concept of variables in Java.
You do not need to understand every concept, but the exposure will help you in making sense of it all:

<h2>Programming Software</h2>
We will be testing out some code today! Luckily, we do not have to install anything - we will use something called Repl.it on a browser of your choice.
<br><br>
Please follow these steps below to get started:
<br><br>
<b>Step 1:</b> Open this link in a new tab on your browser - https://repl.it/languages/java
<br><br>
They might ask you to register first. Ignore them - they are bullies! You could always register later;
registration allows you to save the code you are working on today, which isn't necessary for today's lesson. 
<br><br>
Once the page is ready, you might see the following text:
<br><br>

<br>
<b>Step 2:</b> Click on the blue highlighted word "examples" link, which will bring you to the following page:
<br><br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JDVila/MockLesson/master/repl_it_hello_world_example.png" alt="Repl.it Hello World Example" height="425" width="500">
<br>
<b>Step 3:</b> Bring your mouse arrow pointer over the "Hello World" example to highlight it, then click on it when it is greyed-over. It should bring you to a page that looks like this:
<br><br>

<br>
<b>Step 4 - Final Step:</b> Huzzah! You are now ready to code in Java! Please keep the https://repl.it/languages/java link open, and click the link below to view the lesson:

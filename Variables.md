<h1>Variables: Essentially Boxes that Hold Things.</h1>

As mentioned in a previous lesson (click <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gs1s35daJTko10G4WYKMvKptp0ZvZ7JUw2ZgdK1Gdqw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> to view previous slideshow), A <b>program</b> is a set of instructions that tell a computer: <b>1)</b> What something is, <b>2)</b> To do something, <b>3)</b> How to do something, or <b>4)</b> Any combination of the three. A <b>programming language</b> is a way of writing instructions for computers, that people can also read and understand.

<b><i>Java is a type of programming language.</i></b><br>
<br>
Simply put, <b>Variables</b> are the simplest version of "what something is" part!

Variables are essentially boxes that hold things for you.

For example, let's say you are filling out an online form:<br><br>

<b>&emsp;First Name: ______________ </b>

<b>&emsp;Last Name: ______________ </b>

<b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Age: ______________ </b>
<br>

<br><br>
The answers to each of those questions would need to be stored in three separate "boxes". A "box" for a "First Name," a box for a "Last Name," and a "box for the number "Age."
<br><br>
firstName = "Jose";<br>
lastName = "Vila";<br>
age = 36;<br>
<br>
Easy enough, yes? However, Java is something called a <b>Strongly-Typed</b> language. This means that if you are going to put something in a box (or variable), you have to match the kind of box with the types of things that go into those boxes. In Java, there are simple boxes just for words/sentences, shorter or longer decimal numbers, whole numbers of different sizes, individual letters/characters, and whether something is true, or untrue (false).

<h2>Primitive Variables</h2>
Java has eight "primitive," or non-object data types. All primitive means is that they are the most basic data types that Java allows you to work with. It is the actual value, and not a reference to the value (we'll learn more about the difference between those two in a later lesson).<br>
<br>
There are four for whole numbers:<br>
<br>
&bull; byte<br>
&bull; short<br>
* int<br>
* long<br>
<br>
There are two for decimal numbers:<br>
<br>
* float<br>
* double<br>
<br>
There is one for letters/individual characters:<br>
<br>
* char<br>
<br>
And one for true or false values:<br>
<br>
* boolean<br>
<br>
###Variables for Whole Numbers
<br>
There are four primitive data types for whole numbers. They are different from each other based on <b><i>The Size of The Number</i></b> you want to put in the box/variable.

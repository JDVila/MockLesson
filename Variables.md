<h1>Variables: Essentially Boxes that Hold Things.</h1>

As mentioned in a previous lesson (click <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gs1s35daJTko10G4WYKMvKptp0ZvZ7JUw2ZgdK1Gdqw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> to view previous slideshow), A <b>program</b> is a set of instructions that tell a computer: <b>1)</b> What something is, <b>2)</b> To do something, <b>3)</b> How to do something, or <b>4)</b> Any combination of the three. A <b>programming language</b> is a way of writing instructions for computers, that people can also read and understand.

<b><i>Java is a type of programming language.</i></b>
<br><br>
Simply put, <b>Variables</b> are the simplest version of "what something is" part!
<br><br>
Variables are essentially boxes that hold things for you. For example, let's say you are filling out an online form:
<br><br>
<b>First Name: __________ </b><br>
<b>Last Name: __________ </b><br>
<b>Age: __________ </b><br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JDVila/MockLesson/master/send_button.png" alt="Submit Button" height="55" width="250">
<br><br>
The answers to each of those questions would need to be stored in three separate "boxes". A "box" for a "First Name," a box for a "Last Name," and a "box for the number "Age."

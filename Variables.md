<h1>Variables: Essentially Boxes that Hold Things.</h1>

As mentioned in a previous lesson (click <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gs1s35daJTko10G4WYKMvKptp0ZvZ7JUw2ZgdK1Gdqw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> to view previous slideshow), A <b>program</b> is a set of instructions that tell a computer: <b>1)</b> What something is, <b>2)</b> To do something, <b>3)</b> How to do something, or <b>4)</b> Any combination of the three. A <b>programming language</b> is a way of writing instructions for computers, that people can also read and understand.

<b><i>Java is a type of programming language.</i></b>
<br><br>
Simply put, <b>Variables</b> are the simplest version of "what something is" part!
<br><br>
Variables are essentially boxes that hold things for you.

For example, let's say you are filling out an online form:
<br><br>
<b>&emsp;First Name: ______________ </b><br>
<b>&emsp;Last Name: ______________ </b><br>
<b>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Age: ______________ </b><br>

<br><br>
The answers to each of those questions would need to be stored in three separate "boxes". A "box" for a "First Name," a box for a "Last Name," and a "box for the number "Age."
<br><br>
firstName = "Jose";<br>
lastName = "Vila";<br>
age = 36;
<br><br>
Easy enough, yes? However, Java is something called a <b>Strongly-Typed</b> language. This means that if you are going to put something in a box (or variable), you have to match the kind of box with the types of things that go into those boxes. In Java, there are simple boxes just for words/sentences, shorter or longer decimal numbers, whole numbers of different sizes, individual letters/characters, and whether something is true, or untrue (false).

<h2>Primitive Variables</h2>
Java has eight "primitive," or non-object data types. There are four for whole numbers:
<br><br>
- byte<br>
- short<br>
- int<br>
- long<br>
<br><br>
There are two for decimal numbers:
<br><br>
- float<br>
- double<br>
<br>
There is one for letters/individual characters:
<br><br>
- char
And one for true or false values:
<br><br>
- boolean
